Vscode Extension for Visa take home assignment.

Approach: 
  I wanted to approach this assignment with the idea that I was going to work on something new to me since the allowed use of outside sources to build.
  So in terms of the technical choices I made, I choose to move forward with making a vscode extension since I had no previous experience with making an extension.
  I thought a web page or react app would be pedantic and not as 'user friendly' of a solution to the problem being faced. Having a separate web page for something that
  can already be done in an IDE seems like a lot of wasted movements for a developer. 

  With a vscode extension, as I found out over working on it, was more limiting to the stylization I was accustomed to with working with a web app. 
  It was a lot of javascript embedding html which embedded javascript. 
Assumptions/shortcuts:
  I was assuming from the onset it was going to be like github copilot. However, I made something much more simpler than copilot but somewhat mirroring 
  something akin to chatgpt. I didn't want to mess too much with html and styling as a lot of the functionality which I did NOT want to mock was more for the scripting 
  and configuring the vscode extensions weird props and arguments needed to communicate with the webview and other defined functions.
  I used AI sources to build the styling and HTML and assisting in the UX portion of the extension. I think with a solid backbone its easier to parse what indivudalistic styling 
  decisions I can make later and focus more on the scripting and functionality.
